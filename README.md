2. Connect your smart lock(s) to Seam through their Connect Webview
3. Get your API key from the Seam Console
4. Note down your device IDs

For detailed instructions, visit [Seam Documentation](https://docs.seam.co/latest/)

## Configuration

### Via Homebridge UI

The easiest way to configure the plugin is through the Homebridge UI:

1. Navigate to the plugin settings
2. Enter your Seam API key
3. Add your device(s) with their Device IDs
4. Optionally configure webhooks and polling settings
5. Save and restart Homebridge

### Manual Configuration

Add the following to your Homebridge `config.json`:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "SeamLock",
      "name": "Seam Lock",
      "apiKey": "seam_****_YOUR_API_KEY",
      "devices": [
        {
          "deviceId": "device_****_YOUR_DEVICE_ID",
          "name": "Front Door"
        },
        {
          "deviceId": "device_****_ANOTHER_DEVICE_ID",
          "name": "Back Door"
        }
      ],
      "polling": {
        "interval": 60
      },
      "webhooks": {
        "enabled": true,
        "url": "https://your-domain.com",
        "port": 8080
      },
      "debug": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | string | Yes | - | Your Seam.co API key |
| `devices` | array | Yes | - | Array of device configurations |
| `devices[].deviceId` | string | Yes | - | Device ID from Seam.co |
| `devices[].name` | string | No | Device name | Custom name for the lock |
| `polling.interval` | number | No | 60 | How often to poll for state updates (in seconds) |
| `webhooks.enabled` | boolean | No | false | Enable webhook server |
| `webhooks.url` | string | No | - | Base URL for webhook endpoint (HTTPS recommended) |
| `webhooks.port` | number | No | 8080 | Port for webhook server (local testing) |
| `debug` | boolean | No | false | Enable debug logging |

**Note:** `webhooks.path` and `webhooks.secret` are auto-generated and managed by the plugin.

## Webhook Setup (Optional)

Webhooks provide real-time state updates without constant polling. The plugin automatically manages webhook creation and deletion.

### Production Setup with HTTPS

For production use, set up HTTPS webhooks using stunnel:

#### 1. Install stunnel and certbot

```bash
sudo apt install stunnel4 certbot
```

#### 2. Get SSL certificate

```bash
# Open port 80 on your router and forward it to homebridge port 80
# Stop Homebridge if needed (if your have it on port 80)
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com
```

#### 3. Configure stunnel

Create `/etc/stunnel/homebridge.conf`:

```ini
pid = /var/run/stunnel-homebridge.pid
[homebridge]
accept = 443
connect = 127.0.0.1:8080
cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem
key = /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem
```

#### 4. Start stunnel

```bash
sudo systemctl enable stunnel4
sudo systemctl restart stunnel4
```

#### 5. Configure plugin

Set webhook URL to `https://your-domain.com` in plugin configuration.

### Webhook Features

- **Automatic Management** - Webhooks are created/deleted automatically
- **Secure Paths** - Each webhook gets a unique random UUID path
- **Auto-generated Secrets** - Security secrets are generated automatically
- **Persistent Configuration** - Webhook settings survive plugin updates

**Note:** Without webhooks, the plugin uses polling (default: every 60 seconds) to check lock state.

## Advanced Features

### Automatic Webhook Management

The plugin automatically handles webhook lifecycle:

- **Creation** - Webhooks are created automatically when enabled
- **Deletion** - Webhooks are deleted when disabled
- **Persistence** - Webhook settings survive plugin updates
- **Security** - Each webhook gets a unique random UUID path

### Battery Caching

Battery level is cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls:

- **Efficient** - Reduces unnecessary API requests
- **Accurate** - Fresh data when needed
- **Configurable** - Cache timeout can be adjusted

### Race Condition Protection

Prevents multiple simultaneous lock commands:

- **Command Queue** - Commands are queued and executed sequentially
- **Timeout Protection** - Commands timeout after 15 seconds
- **State Locking** - Prevents polling interference during commands

### Real Device Information

Shows actual device data in HomeKit:

- **Manufacturer** - Real manufacturer name (e.g., "August", "Yale")
- **Model** - Actual model name from device
- **Serial Number** - Real serial number from device
- **Firmware** - Device firmware version

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin doesn't start

- Check that your API key is correct
- Ensure device IDs are valid
- Check Homebridge logs for error messages

### Lock state not updating

- Verify your lock is online in Seam Console
- Check polling interval in configuration
- Enable debug mode for more detailed logs

### Webhook not working

- Ensure webhook port is accessible from the internet
- Check firewall and router port forwarding settings
- Verify webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Check plugin logs for webhook registration status
- For HTTPS setup, ensure SSL certificate is valid

### Device data not showing

- Enable debug logging to see device information extraction
- Check if device provides manufacturer/model data in Seam Console
- Some devices may not have complete information

### Low battery not showing

- Some locks don't report battery level
- Check if battery level is available in Seam Console
- Battery data is cached for 1 hour to reduce API calls

### Lock commands not working

- Check if device is online in Seam Console
- Verify API key has proper permissions
