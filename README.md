For detailed instructions, visit [Seam Documentation](https://docs.seam.co/latest/)

## Configuration

### Via Homebridge UI

The easiest way to configure the plugin is through the Homebridge UI:

1. Navigate to the plugin settings
2. Enter your Seam API key
3. Add your device(s) with their Device IDs
4. Optionally configure webhooks and polling settings
5. Save and restart Homebridge

### Manual Configuration

Add the following to your Homebridge `config.json`:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "SeamLock",
      "name": "Seam Lock",
      "apiKey": "seam_****_YOUR_API_KEY",
      "devices": [
        {
          "deviceId": "device_****_YOUR_DEVICE_ID",
          "name": "Front Door"
        },
        {
          "deviceId": "device_****_ANOTHER_DEVICE_ID",
          "name": "Back Door"
        }
      ],
      "polling": {
        "interval": 60
      },
      "webhooks": {
        "enabled": false,
        "port": 8080,
        "path": "/webhook"
      },
      "debug": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | string | Yes | - | Your Seam.co API key |
| `devices` | array | Yes | - | Array of device configurations |
| `devices[].deviceId` | string | Yes | - | Device ID from Seam.co |
| `devices[].name` | string | No | Device name | Custom name for the lock |
| `polling.interval` | number | No | 60 | How often to poll for state updates (in seconds) |
| `webhooks.enabled` | boolean | No | false | Enable webhook server |
| `webhooks.port` | number | No | 8080 | Port for webhook server |
| `webhooks.path` | string | No | /webhook | URL path for webhook endpoint |
| `debug` | boolean | No | false | Enable debug logging |

## Webhook Setup (Optional)

Webhooks provide real-time state updates without constant polling:

1. Enable webhooks in plugin configuration
2. Set up port forwarding or use a service like ngrok to expose your webhook endpoint
3. Register your webhook URL in Seam Console or the plugin will attempt to do it automatically

**Note:** Without webhooks, the plugin uses polling (default: every 60 seconds) to check lock state.

## Supported Devices

This plugin supports any smart lock that works with Seam.co, including:

- August Smart Lock (all generations)
- Yale Assure Lock (all models)
- Schlage Encode

- and many more!
